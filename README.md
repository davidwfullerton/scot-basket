# ScotBasket

##Software Versions

* Ruby version 2.3.1p112

* Rails version 5.0.1

##Setup

After cloning the repository use the following steps to setup the server locally:

* If necessary run `apt-get install libz-dev` because the nokogirl gem requires this.

* If necessary run `apt-get install nodejs` because the uglifier gem requires this.

* Run `bundle install` to install required gems.

* Run `rake db:migrate` to setup your database.

* Run `rake db:seed` to populate catalog entries table based on `seeds.rb`

* Run `bundle exec rails s` and the server will be hosted at `localhost:3000`

##Scripting

Currently this feature has been replaced by the use of seeds.rb, however the feature still exists and can be used to add more itemes to the catalog.

The script `load_catalog_entries` takes two CSV files, `gov_rates.csv` and `catalog.csv`, and imports the necessary data into the database under the class CatalogEntry, to be referenced later by the application.

* `gov_rates.csv` holds the data regarding VAT types and the equivalent VAT rates. This allows the rates to be easily changed if needed.
* `catalog.csv` holds the data about the products support by ScotBasket and their VAT types. If you wanted to add a new product you would create a new row in this CSV.

If you do make changes to the CSV file and want to update the database run `rake db:reload_catalog_entries`. If you run `rake db:load_catalog_entries` instead, this will result in multiple copies of the information in the database and will raise errors when the application runs. If this happens running `rake db:reload_catalog_entries` will resolve this.

##Testing

Run `bundle exec rspec spec/` to run the rspec tests. This includes the three provided test cases.

##Possible Future Addition

It had been my intention to add a feature where if the user's subtotal was close to the Â£70 needed for the discount to apply, then a notification would appear informing the user that they recieve the 12% discount if they added another item.
